# PS_UninstallAppDetectionMethod

Template Powershell-Pased Detection Methods for Uninstall Applications in SCCM

Intended for use in Task Sequences, since in them, you can't specify an app to uninstall instead of installing

Therefore these detection methods could be applied to SCCM App objects whose purpose is to uninstall the source, instead of installing it
